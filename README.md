# Flappy
Flappy bird from Tech With Tim, using Neuro-Evolution-Augmenting-Topologies a.k.a NEAT algorithm 

with physical dynamic laws refined, (gravity mechanism was WRONG in Tim's toturial, please be careful!)

reward function is redesigned, primarily as the distance (in meters) that flappy bird has traveled

passing a pipe is rewarded as same as traveling 2 meters

Or, see Tim's tutorial:
